My plan is to define every topic on day by day with sequence we started on 2023-05-06 but in weekend I deploy a data science end-to-end project on (IPL) dataset which algorithms predict winning teams in behalf of players and his performance. Every weekend I am deploying projects on Machine Learning and Deep Learning both. Please show your feedback to me I am just beginner...
